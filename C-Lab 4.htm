		<p>Bette Nesmith had a good secretarial job in a Dallas bank when she ran across a problem that interest her. Wasn't there a better way to correct the errrors whe made on her electric type wrtier? Bette had some art experience and she knew that artists who worked in oils just painted over thair errors. Maybe that would work for her too. So she concocted a fluid to paint over her typing errors. Before long, all the secreataries in her building were using what she then called &quot;MistakeOut&quot;. She attempted to sell the product idea to marketing agencies and various companies (including IBM), but they turned her down. However, secreatries continued to like her product, so Bette Nesmith's kitchen became her first manufacturing facility and she started selling it on her own. When Bette Nesmith sold the enterprise, the tiny white bottles were earning $3.5 million annually on sales of $38 million. The buyer was Gillette Company and the sal eprice was $47.5 million.</p>

		<p>Persistence paid offf for American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto. After astronomers calculated a probable orbit for this &quot;suspected&quot; heavenly body, Tombaugh took up the search in March 1929. Time magazine recorded the investifation: &quot;He examined scores of telescopic photographs each showin gtens of thousands of star images in pairs undeer the dual microscope. It often took three days to scan a single pair. It was exhausting, eye-cracking work-in his own words, &quot;brutal, tediousness.&quot; And it went on fo rmonths, Star by star, he examined 20 million images. Then on Febrauary 18, 1930, as he was blinking at a pair of photographs in the constellation Gemeini, &quot;I suddenly cam eupon the image of Pluto!&quot; It was the most dramatic astronomic discovery in nearly 100 years.</p>
