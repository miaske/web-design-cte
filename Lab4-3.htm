		<p>Your resume is a summary of your education, accomplishments, and hopefully a reflections of how you can benefit a potentioal employer. When you start applying for jobs, most potential employers will request a resume along with the application. Your resume is a much better reflection of the type of employee you will be, therefore it is important to put a lot of thought and attention into preparing your resume. When putting together your resume, remember these important points.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Appearance:</span> Resumes should be printed on good quality bond paper, use well balanced margins and adequate spacing to give an attractive and uncrowded appearance.</li>
			<li><span>Headings:</span> Use major headings and sub headings to identify and organie the information. Make it easy fo rhte reader to locate and understand your qualifications.</li>
			<li><span>Correctness & Neatness:</span> A correct and neat resume is free of typographical errors, smudges, noticeable corrections, misspelled words, and grammatical errors.</li>
			<li><span>Consciseness:</span> Limit th eresume to two pages. Eliminate personal pronouns and passive verbs, present your information in breif phrrases. Say "promoted to assistant store manager" instead of "I was made assistant manager".</li>
			<li><span>Parallelism:</span> Be consistent in wording, arranging headings and facts, spacing, indenting, and capitalizing.</li>
