		<ol>
		  <li>Thou shalt consider the type of groups best suited to tackle thy task (advisory group, expert group, large group for brainstorming)</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt know thy communication style.</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt choose thy members wisely</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt be the champion for their group's task.</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt get a few things straight among participants before proceeding (when will they meet, authority level of members)</li>
		  <li>Thou art empowered to demand things of thy participants</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt have thy logistical house in order before any meeting (know why the meeting is taking place)</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt keep thy members and interested parties thoroughly apprised of the progress of thy group toward completion of its tasks.</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt act as consensus-builder, not Lord High Executioner</li>
		  <li>Thou shalt promote mutual respect and discourage personal attacks among thy members</li>
