		<h1>The Aesop's Fables</h1>

			<h2>The Lion and the Statue</h2>
			<p>A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions in general. The Man contended that he and his fellows were stronger than lions by reason of their greater intelligence. &quot;Come now with me,&quot; he cried, &quot;and I will soon prove that I am right.&quot; So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a statue of Hercules overcoming the Lion and tearing his mouth in two. &quot;That is all very well,&quot; said the Lion, &quot;but proves nothing, for it was a man who made the statue.&quot;</p>

			<h2>The Wind and the Sun</h2>
			<p>The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. Suddenly they saw a traveler coming down the road, and the Sun said: &quot;I see a way to decide our dispute. Whichever of us can cause that traveler to take off cloak shal be regarded as the stronger. You begin.&quot; So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as it could upon the traveler. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveler wrap his cloak around him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveler, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on.</p>

			<h2>The Shepherd's Boy</h2>
			<p>There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him al day, so he thought upon a pan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out &quot;Wolf, Wolf,&quot; and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out &quot;Wolf, Wolf,&quot; still louder than before. But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy's flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said:</p>
			<p><em>&quot;A liar will not be believed even when he speaks the truth.&quot;</em></p>
